Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 
Hello! My name is Alkim and I am currently a senior concentrating in Applied Math and Biology (neuroscience). 
I am from Ankara, Turkey and my favorite food is profiteroles -even though it's technically a dessert. 
I am super excited for this course in general. Thank you :)
